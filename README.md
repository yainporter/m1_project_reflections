You will need to copy this markdown, create your own **private** gist, and paste this markdown in your own gist. After each project, you will take time to come back to your private gist and answer each of the questions that are outlined for you below. 

# M1 Project Reflections

## Warmup Project 
1. How do you approach solving something when you don’t have all the information?
2. What was your most effective strategy for getting through blockers during this project? How did this help your process?
3. Tell us about a time that you found yourself in an unproductive struggle, how did you get out of it?
4. What was the benefit of using TDD while building out this project?

## First Solo
1. Pick 1 technical concept you used for this project (look back at our lessons and the learning goals of the project to pick this). Explain what this concept is, how it works, and give an example of where you used this in your code. 
2. What was your process when you got stuck? 
3. If you had to do this project again, what would you do differently and why?

## Second Solo
1. Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.
2. What was the benefit of using TDD while building out this project?
3. What was a resource that you used during this project and how did you use this to move your project forward?

## Paired Paired
1. What was your pairing style like? How did you manage your Github work flow? What are your thoughts on that workflow?
2. What skill do you feel you have a better handle on after working on this project? What skill has this project lead you to realize you need more practice on?
3. What strategies help you best work with others? What would you like others to know about how you work best?

## Group Project
1. Group: What conflicts came up and how did you resolve them?  This could look like different opinions on how to code a method, what to name a class, when to do stand ups, or communication breakdowns.
2. Pick 1 technical concept you used for this project (look back at our lessons and the learning goals of the project to pick this). Explain what this concept is, how it works, and give an example of where you used this in your code. 
3. Describe your team’s code review process. How did you ensure your end product worked and was of high quality?

You will need to copy this markdown, create your own **private** gist, and paste this markdown in your own gist. After each project, you will take time to come back to your private gist and answer each of the questions that are outlined for you below. 

# M1 Project Reflections

## Warmup Project 

### Project Overview

#### List out the tools you used:
1. RSpec
2. Pry
3. VS Code
4. Terminal
...

#### Write a 1-2 sentence synopsis of what this project does:



### Reflection Questions: 
**1. How do you approach solving something when you don’t have all the information?**<br />

When I don't have all the information that I need to solve a problem, I first look at what I do have, and then I try to clarify what it is that I am solving.

Once I understand what it is that I am expected to solve, and I don't know how to solve it, that's when I refer to google. After googling and finding something that may work, I refer to Ruby Docs, and then I google a more general description to try and connect the dots between the two resources until I understand the Ruby Docs.

**2. What was your most effective strategy for getting through blockers during this project? How did this help your process?**<br />

Sleep helped me a lot! It was important to take time off when I was stuck and step away from the screen. Coming in with a fresh perspective helped me see things in a new light.

**3. Tell us about a time that you found yourself in an unproductive struggle, how did you get out of it?**<br />
**4. What was the benefit of using TDD while building out this project?**<br />

Honestly, I didn't do TDD until Iteration 4, but I can see how it could have been really useful for me in figuring out how to tackle #take_turn. Going with a TDD method breaks down a difficult task into smaller parts.

I was in a bit of an unproductive struggle with #take_turn, so I zoomed out of the method, and looked at the whole class, and that helped me to refocus where I was going.
